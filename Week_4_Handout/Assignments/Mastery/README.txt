Assignments in this folder serve three purposes:

1.) Provide an additional layer of challenge and understanding for those students who are capable.
	a.) Completing these assignments will grow your abilities and make future assignments easier.
	b.) Highly recommended for developers who wish to work in or adjacent to graphics programming. 

2.) Allow students who have fallen seriously behind (25% or less on Labs) a path back on track through hard work.
	a.) Fully completing a mastery assignment before the final day of class can update its main assignment by adding 25 points to the original grade.
	b.) If you fully complete a mastery assignment for this reason inform your grading instructor immediately!
	c.) If you failed an assignment due to academic dishonesty, this is not a way to mitigate that.

3.) Make-up missing course hours that may otherwise cause you to fail the class.
	a.) Each mastery assignment can be used to make-up one missed day of class.(6 hours)
	b.) If you want to use a mastery assignment in this way please inform myself or the lab specialists A.S.A.P.

Additional Notes:
	a.) All mastery assignments must be completed before the end of the final day of class.
	b.) You must directly inform the grading staff as soon as you have submitted a mastery so it can be counted/graded.
